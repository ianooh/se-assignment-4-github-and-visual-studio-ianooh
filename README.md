Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later. It is essential in software development for managing changes, collaborating among multiple developers, and maintaining a history of modifications.

Key Concepts of Version Control with Git
Repository (Repo): A directory that contains your project's files and the entire revision history. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).
Commit: A snapshot of the project files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a commit message describing the changes made.
Branch: A parallel version of the repository. The main branch is the default, but new branches can be created to work on features or fixes independently.
Merge: The process of combining changes from different branches into a single branch. It integrates new features or fixes into the main codebase.
Pull Request: A request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically used for code review and discussion before the changes are integrated.
Clone: Creating a local copy of a remote repository on your computer. You can work on this local copy and sync it with the remote repository.
Push and Pull: Push uploads your local changes to the remote repository, while Pull fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository to your local copy.
Remote: A shared repository on a server that team members use to exchange their changes. origin is the default name for a remote repository.
